# Phase 18.0 Implementation Results

## Implemented Features

### 1. Normalized Receipt (Makbuz) System
- **Database**: Created `receipts` table with `id`, `donation_id`, and `barcode_data`.
- **Entity**: `Receipt` entity implemented.
- **Service**: `ReceiptService` created to generate unique barcodes (`SB-{Year}-{UUID}`) and manage receipt lifecycle.
- **API**: `GET /api/v1/receipts/verify/{barcode}` endpoint implemented for public verification. Returns masked donor name and donation details.
- **Integration**: `DonationService` automatically triggers receipt creation upon successful donation completion.

### 2. Campaign Realization Tracking
- **Entity**: `Campaign` entity updated with `realization_deadline` (DateTime) and `realization_status` (String/Enum).
- **API**: 
    - `PUT /api/v1/campaigns/{id}/realization` implemented for admins to update status and deadline.
    - `CampaignResponse` DTO updated to include these fields for frontend display.

### 3. Mock Payment & Direct Donation
- **API**: `POST /api/v1/payments/direct` implementation for simplified payment flow.
- **Logic**: 
    - Validates card patterns (e.g., blocking "5100" for testing).
    - Completes donation and generates transaction record.
    - Triggers receipt generation immediately.
